## About This Project

A low-level image processing project implementing high-pass filters using both C and x86 Assembly language, with multithreading for optimal performance.

### Features

- **Dual Implementation**: Both C and x86 Assembly versions
- **Multithreading**: Parallel processing for improved performance
- **Benchmark System**: Separate DLLs for performance comparison
- **C# Interface**: Managed wrapper for easy integration

### Technical Details

- x86 Assembly language for maximum performance
- C implementation for comparison
- Multithreaded architecture
- DLL-based architecture for modular benchmarking

### Purpose

This project demonstrates low-level programming skills and understanding of CPU optimization, parallel processing, and system-level programming.
