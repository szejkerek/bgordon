## About This Publication

This research paper explores the use of Kinect depth sensors for cognitive rehabilitation of elderly individuals, developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Oncology.

### Research Overview

**Title:** Rehabilitation of Cognitive Functions of the Elderly with the Use of Depth Sensors - The Preliminary Results

**Published in:** Innovations in Biomedical Engineering, 2024, pages 41-50

### Project Background

This publication stemmed from a University Project Based Learning initiative (October 2021 - February 2022), where we developed an interactive application to improve the lives of elderly individuals through rehabilitation opportunities.

### Key Contributions

- Developed interactive rehabilitation exercises using Kinect sensors
- Implemented real-time motion tracking and feedback systems
- Contributed to user testing and data analysis
- Co-authored the final research paper

### Impact

The project demonstrates the potential of accessible technology in healthcare settings, particularly for cognitive rehabilitation of elderly patients.
